# Welcome to Ruby

Ruby is an object oriented, dynamically-typed, high-level scripting language. It is a programming language that was written for humans and just happens to run on computers. It's intended to promote developer happiness through simplicity, elegant libraries, and terse, readable syntax. As a result of these considerations, some sacrifices had to be made in terms of memory use and execution speed.
